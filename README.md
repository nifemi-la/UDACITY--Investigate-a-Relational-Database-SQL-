# UDACITY--Investigate-a-Relational-Database using SQL
The Sakila Movie database is a SQL database of online DVD rentals. I will query the database to answer questions about business decisions and plot my visualizations using Python. 
These visualizations are then used to answer these questions and serve as key justifications in a PowerPoint presentation.

This Database holds key information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the Sakila DVD Rental database to gain an understanding of the customer base, including patterns in movie watching across different customer groups, payment earnings comparisons, and performance comparisons between stores.
